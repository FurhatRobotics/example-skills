# Running skills
1. Clone the repository, `git clone https://github.com/FurhatRobotics/example-skills`
2. In IntelliJ IDEA, import each individual skill as a new gradle project (or module if you have an existing project) (use the _from existing source_ alternative and select the _build.gradle_ file)
3. Make sure you have the Furhat SDK development server or a robot running.
4. If the skill has a GUI (currently only the FurGUI skill), run `npm install` in the GUI root folder
5. Run the skill by the main method in the skill's `main.kt` file. If you want to run on a robot, see [this part of the docs](https://docs.furhat.io/skills/#running-a-skill-on-a-robot)
